## Our Pledge

We are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment for all contributors to the Claude Agent SDK Go project. We pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are dedicated to building a community where people can collaborate effectively, learn from each other, and contribute their best work in a supportive atmosphere.

We encourage behaviors that contribute to a healthy, productive community:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Providing and accepting constructive feedback gracefully
- Taking responsibility for our mistakes, apologizing to those affected, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what benefits the community and project as a whole
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being patient with newcomers and those learning
- Recognizing and appreciating the contributions of others

### Unacceptable Behaviors

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our community:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment of any kind
- Publishing others' private information (such as physical or email addresses) without explicit permission
- Deliberately intimidating, stalking, or following others
- Sustained disruption of discussions or project activities
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces, including but not limited to:

- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Code reviews and technical discussions
- Project documentation and wikis
- Communication channels (if established)
- Events or meetings related to the project

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces, such as using an official project email address, posting via official social media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at events.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported to the project maintainers. You may:

- Open a confidential issue on GitHub
- Email the project maintainers at victorcodes@proton.me

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining consequences for violations:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in project spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the project community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project community.
